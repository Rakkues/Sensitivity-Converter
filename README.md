# Sensitivity-Converter

## Credits
This app was created as a practice project to recreate online game sensitivity converters using Python and Tkinter.
All credit goes to https://armorygaminggear.com/ and https://gamingsmart.com/mouse-sensitivity-converter/.

## How to use
Simply input the game title, mouse DPI and in-game sensitivity from which you wish to convert from and the game title and mouse DPI of the game to wish to convert to.
The newly calculated in-game sensitivity will then be available for you to copy and use in your selected game.
